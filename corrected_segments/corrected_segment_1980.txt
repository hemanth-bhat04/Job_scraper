{"content":"do the grouping here so initially these two can group a b c and a b bar c in this one then these two groups you can do then when you plug that you get this expression so now you're done with the boolean expression the simplified one the last one that is left out is implementing it using your circuit so you have the c out so you need an and gate you need an or gate for s you need one xor gate with three inputs so for s over here i don't have an xor gate with three inputs so i'm using two two input xor gates so this generates me my sum for carry implement this i need and gate and or gates so and gates and or gates so inside this full adder i have these gates inside these gates basically it is your transistors."}
