{"content":"okay, so now that completes today's session. We are left out with one more portion of it that is using a multiplexer circuit, how we can go for designing all your basic gates? We'll look into it, so we'll take up two to one multiplexer circuit and try to design all your basic circuits. Any queries related to the sessions that we have done till now okay, so if there are no other queries, we'll proceed with it. I'll open a whiteboard, so hope this whiteboard is visible to you, so now we will try to design all your basic gates using two to one multiplexer circuit, so design a basic gate design, basic gates"}
