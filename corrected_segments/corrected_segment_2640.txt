{"content":"So this is a full adder circuit for a means full adder over here, so it takes C and the two bits A and B, and this is a true table of a full adder circuit which you have already seen; over here instead of using this full adder circuit we'll design a carry look ahead adder. So if you go for a carry look ahead adder the C in which is getting generated from the previous full adder circuit and for the C each of your full adder circuit has to wait for the previous full adder circuit to generate your C out; so instead of waiting for the C out we'll rig up a new circuit which calculates the C right from using these bits that is a one bit one A two B two A three B three and one more bit if you have."}
