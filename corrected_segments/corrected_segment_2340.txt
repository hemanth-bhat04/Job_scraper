{"content":"data so a naught b naught over here so one plus one full adder circuit is adding one and one here so one plus one sum is zero here carry in i'll consider it as zero previously so the carry in that is coming over here i'll consider it as zero so one plus one is zero it is zero so that zero is added with this carry in so to give me a sum as zero over here so what is a carryout carryout is one carryout is one so that one comes here as carry into the second full adder now what is the input for the second full adder zero and one so zero plus one sum is one carry is zero now one plus one sum is zero carry is one again carry one is given here what is the inputs to the third full adder"}
