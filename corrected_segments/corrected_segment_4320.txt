{"content":"okay, so now over here, I have three select lines. It's not one I over here, not three select pins, two select lines and the input I, so now first slide, let's generate the truth table of it, because that is a design procedure, so select line zero, zero when your select line is zero, zero whatever is there in i, whatever is there in i that will be going to y, naught when your select line is one, whatever is there in i that goes to y one after that, it goes to y two after that, it goes to y three and so on. Clear with this, so this is a truth table, so from the truth table if you write the expression, this is the expression I get for y three, y two, y one, y naught, it is simple, so y one, if you see this one only at this case right"}
