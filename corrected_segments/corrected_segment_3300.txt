{"content":"k map so this is the simplest one directly you get this expression for borrow and difference so a bar plus a bar b this can be implemented using xor gate a bar b can be implemented using a not and and gate so that is quite clear so this is the circuit of your half subtracted inside my half subtracted block i'm having xor gate and this one is in not gate over here this bubble means you should have a not gate here and an and gate so inside these gates i'm having transistors basically so you have already seen how many transistors you need for xor gate for and gates and so on in the previous session again this half subtractor doesn't consider the borrow from the previous bit if you want a borrow from the previous bit to be included you need to go for a full subtractor circuit wherein along with a and b each of these are one bits remember i have a borrow in the output is again same borrow out"}
