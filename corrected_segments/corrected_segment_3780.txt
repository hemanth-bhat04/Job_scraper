{"content":"one bit is not enough, now i need two bits of select lines that are s naught and s one, when s naught and s one are zero, a is sent to out whatever is in a goes to my output, when s not in s one are zero one, whatever is in b goes to my output for one zero whatever is in c goes to your output for one one whatever is in d goes to my output clear with it again, it is same way, it is connecting either a is going here or d is going here or c is going here or b is going that purely depends on the values of s naught and s one so if you have four inputs, four inputs means in powers of two, if you write it as 2 to the power two, so 2 to the power of two, it is so this two"}
