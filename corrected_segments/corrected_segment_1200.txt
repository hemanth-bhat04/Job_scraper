{"content":"Yes, Venkata Mohan, ma'am. Where we use SOP and POS, ma'am? In which this way, we can't use POS, ma'am. You can use POS, no problem. Yes, you get the same functionality. So that decision, the design engineer will do using POS, if you're able to implement the circuit with less number of logic gates then POS expression is implemented otherwise usually they go for SOP because that is comfortable. Okay, but if SOP is giving you a larger circuit with respect to gate count then and if POS is giving you a reduced expression then definitely we go for POS that is purely the design engineer's decision. You cannot generalize that you have to implement using SOP or POS that again depends on the specification in some of"}
