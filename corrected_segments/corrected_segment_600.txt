{"content":"be determining sorry you will be determining the number of inputs and outputs required to implement this problem statement once you decide how many number of inputs and outputs are required to determine this to implement this function then in step three you assign appropriate names to each of the input and output variables so sometimes the step two and step three might be combined no issues here we have given it separately so once you determine the number of inputs and outputs directly you assign labels or names to those input and output variables so when you assign a label you have to follow a procedure or you have to follow a protocol just cannot randomly give a label to the input and output variables a b c x y zed"}
