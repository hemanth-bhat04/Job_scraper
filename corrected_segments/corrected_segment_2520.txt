{"content":"inside the circuit you have full adders and these full adders are has to wait for the input to be generated so the propagation delay of this entire ripple calle adder is increased do you agree with this because the second full adder has to wait for the c out from the first full adder similarly third full adder should wait for the c out from the second full adder so the propagation delay for this s naught to be generated for this final not s naught sorry for this s three to be generated for this final s three to be generated is too high right because it has to wait for all the three full adders so this is the drawback of your ripple carry adder so in order to avoid this particular propagation delay they went for designing another full adder circuit that is called as carry look ahead adder circuit so is this a concept of a ripple carry adder and the disadvantage of your ripple carry"}
