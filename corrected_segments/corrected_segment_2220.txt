{"content":"six gates we needed so each of this full adder was using six basic gates and each of these basic gates is made up of what it is made up of transistor so so if you consider these and gates this and gates it might take around eight transistors or get another eight transistor exor get another ten to twelve transistor so if you see each of your full adders is taking around twenty five to thirty transistors so if you have four such full adders you have the count multiplied by four so from the transistor count and imagine the number of area or the size of from the transistor count just imagine the area that is required to implement all these circuits so it is really too huge so if you want to add more than one bit of data then you have to go for a ripple carry adder you cannot go with"}
