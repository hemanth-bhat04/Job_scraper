{"content":"carry look ahead adder is giving you a better propagation delay so that is why we go for this carry look ahead adder implementation if time is the crucial thing in implementing your circuit otherwise you can go with the triple carrier circuit itself clear with this all of you yes ma'am now let's look into the half adders sorry half subtractor circuit so similar to your half adder half subtractor is doing the difference binary difference so it considers two inputs a b and generates a border and a difference now let's refer back to this design flow of your combo circuit that is these steps i'm coming back again and again so that you remember it don't by heart it analyze it understand it so i'm done with it understanding the problem statement i know how many number of inputs i have assigned a variable to it also the next thing i have is populate the truth table derive the expression"}
