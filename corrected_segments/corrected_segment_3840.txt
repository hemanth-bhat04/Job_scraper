{"content":"whatever is this two that decides the number of select pins so in general i write two to the power of n so if the number of inputs are two to the power n then whatever value for n i get that becomes the number of select lines got it so this is a simple two is to one multiplexer we have taken here and we will see how we can design this two is to one multiplexer circuit remember there is a design procedure for all combinational circuits now we will look into the design procedure of your two is to one multiplexer circuit so as i told you once you come up with the number of inputs and assign a label to those inputs the next step is write the truth table that is write the pop-up for this truth table so now how many inputs i have a b and one select line so three inputs so three inputs means two to the power three eight different combinations in the truth table i guess a b s"}
