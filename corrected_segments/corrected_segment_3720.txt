{"content":"so what is the first step in deciding your inputs but here since it's a two-to-one multiplexer we have finalized with your inputs A B S is your output S is also an input out is your output so now how do you decide how many select lines you need that purely depends on the number of inputs that are available for a multiplexer circuit now since it's two-to-one max one select pin is sufficient so on the other hand if you had to design a four-to-one mux if you had to design a four-to-one multiplexer circuit wherein I had four inputs so four inputs I'll label them as A B C D and again one single out output so now one S bit is not enough because S can take the value either zero or one either zero or one"}
