{"content":"y should be equal to a bar if a is your input so this is my symbol not gate a i have here i should get a bar at the output which is y now let's look how we can design it here so this is my two is to one multiplexer circuit i have two inputs one select line when select line is equal to zero this is my output y so let's say this is my inverter circuit so when input is zero let's consider this input here so this input whatever i have let me assign it to your select line so when a is equal to zero what should be your output for an inverter circuit when a is zero this case tell me the inputs give me inputs o"}
