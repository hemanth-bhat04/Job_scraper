six steps that is given in step one, what we do this is a procedure for designing a combinational logic circuit so over here in this logic design subject please try to analyze the methodology that we follow because this methodology are very important and these are the some of the basic questions which will be asked in your interview as well they try to dig out what is the methodology or what is the procedure for designing any digital circuits so these questions they might slightly twist and ask you so you should be enabled to answer to all those questions so if you understand the concepts definitely even if the questions are twisted you will be able to answer it so let's look into what are the different steps for designing a combinational logic circuit step one, understand the problem statement say for example in the previous session we have taken an example right i will play lawn tennis if ami joins me or if it is raining
