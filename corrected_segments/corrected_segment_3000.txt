{"content":"tables that is a one b one a naught b naught and the c in so i need not wait for this full adder circuit i need not wait for this full adder circuit to get this c naught in order to calculate this c one or this s one directly i can generate it similarly if you write the expression for c two from here generalized c two is equal to g two plus p two c two minus one is one it is now substitute the value for g two p two and for c one c one"}
