{"content":"okay, so I get this expression for C out, using the C out expression, using the C out expression, I write a generalized expression for all the C out that is getting generated now, this A B that I have here, this A B, I've just represented by G. I'll just write it G similarly, A X R B, this I'll just represented by P. That's your variable, so this is one variable P. This is one variable G, now the C in C in is nothing but the carry in that is coming from your previous edition, so that is why I'll write it as C i minus one because for the current one, for the current C out, the C in is from the previous one, so C out is the present one, the C out I've written it as C i, because it's the present one with respect to this present one."}
