{"content":"can be one or zero input at your B also can be one or zero it can be anything so what a multiplexer does it will just pass whatever is there in A it will just pass to the output it will just send it to the output if select line is equal to zero similarly whatever is there in B either it is zero or one it will just send it to the output if your select line is equal to one so if select line is equal to one whatever is there in B is passed out to your output line if your select line is zero whatever is in A is passed out to my output line clear so this is about the functionality of your multiplexer circuit again this is a combinational logic circuit so we need to follow the same design procedure we have to follow the same design procedure as we have adopted for all these circuits that is these design steps this one so follow this procedure to design your multiplexer circuit as well"}
