{"content":"half subtractor full subtractor and so on so let's look into the design steps that we have already discussed let's match with it and then proceed for further so in this particular slide we will look into the designing of a half adder circuit now this half adder circuit is a combinational circuit that you need to design what is the functionality of this half adder so they've given you directly a specification you need to design a half adder so it is not a very complex circuit a simple circuit that you need to design so the problem statement is you need to design an half adder circuit using the previous procedure that you followed that is step one to step six so first is you have to understand the functionality of a half adder so we know half adder is nothing but a circuit which adds two inputs a and b and generates a sum and a carry output so first thing is understand the problem statement that is step one"}
