{"content":"so let's move on with that with the half subtractor so i have this two tables a b are the two inputs so i get four combinations here be careful with the subtraction zero minus zero borrow is zero borrow means the borrow that they're getting from outside it is zero difference is zero zero minus one zero is a smaller number smaller minus larger you need to get a borrow so in binary when you get a borrow it is equal into two so you got a borrow so your borrow term becomes one two minus one difference is one next one minus one larger minus smaller one minus sorry one minus zero your borrow you're not getting anything zero one minus zero difference is one next one minus zero difference is zero borrow is also zero so you're done with the truth table now generate your output function for borrow separately for difference separately using"}
