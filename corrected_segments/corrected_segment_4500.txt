{"content":"through a demultiplexer circuit because at any instant of time, any one of your output is high you see the output truth table at any instant of time, any one of the output is high right here y one is high sorry y naught is high in the first row then y one is high then y two then y three got it so this is how your demultiplex circuit is used as a switch control in an analog circuit design so this is the summary of it so, in this session we have learned to design a half either full either half subtractor full either subtractor multiplexer and demultiplexer circuits all these are the combinational circuits and it has been designed in the same procedure that we have followed in the first slide the design step any questions with this"}
