and so on, anything to depict the functionality and then totally f so group of logic gates or a bunch of logic gates constitute your combinational logic circuit but all these circuits interconnections are purely dependent on the specification that is given to you that is what type of circuit you are designing so that is purely dependent on the boolean function that you want to implement and this boolean function in turn is dependent on the specification that is given to you clear with this so this is your basic requirement of a combinational logic circuit so let's look into the design procedures of a combinational logic circuit these design steps are important so please understand these design steps the if you follow these design step you can go with designing any combination logic circuit that is given to you so totally here there
