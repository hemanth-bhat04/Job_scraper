{"content":"so, what is the next step? Next step is reduce or reduce a boolean expression from the truth table by applying either method or by using your boolean laws. All this procedure we have already discussed it so, from a given specification or from a given problem statement, how we decide the number of input variables? How we write the truth table and from that truth table, how we derive a boolean expression or a boolean function using k map and or boolean loss? We have already seen an example. So, that is the next step in designing a combinational logic circuit. So, once you get an expression, you know what operators to be used for each operator. We have seen a logic gate. We have built a logic gate. Basic logic gates like AND and OR derived gates like NAND and NOR XOR XNOR so on. From the boolean expression, draw the logic circuit to obtain"}
