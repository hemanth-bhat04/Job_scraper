{"content":"so one more bit if you consider here be aught and one more carrier look ahead added so this is s be aught and my c in is here this is b so so this is one more carry look ahead one more of a ladder circuit so four bits of data if you consider so now let's design a new adder circuit which calculates your carrying that is generated just from using your bits be aught b be aught a one b one a two b two a three b three how can we do with it so over here this is the expression for c out i have this is the expression for c out that i'm getting so how did we get this so if you see here c out it is one for these two conditions right i mean these four conditions so when you reduce the expression for this one using your sop form you get this particular expression of c"}
