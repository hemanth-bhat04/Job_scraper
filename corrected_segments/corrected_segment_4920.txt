{"content":"so in order to design the remaining gates, we have to assign any one of the inputs of the gates to the select pin. So what I'll do is I'll assign A to the select pin. Select Pin is equal to A now you see A is equal to zero. What is your output? Output is zero and one is it same as my B by is same as B right when B is zero, output is zero. When B is one output is one so when S is equal to zero means A is equal to zero what should be my output Y Y is nothing but B itself now again you see here that A is equal to one what is your output Output is always one it is not dependent on this B when B zero or one output is always one so S is equal to A is equal to one means"}
