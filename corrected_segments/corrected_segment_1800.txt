{"content":"the zero plus one zero plus one sum is one carry previously it was one so any doubts in this truth table of a full adder circuit no ma'am so this is clear and easy so we are done with populating the truth table we are we are done with populating the truth table so that covers your step four here it's step four the next step is five and six that is reduce boolean expression and implement the circuit so in order to reduce a boolean expression you have to use k map method so plot the k map for eight input bits that is totally eight combinations zero to seven so c is here a and b are here so this is the k map that i get so again here i cannot combine any of your inputs that means i cannot do any grouping all the"}
