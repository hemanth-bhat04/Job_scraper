{"content":"for difference and borrow now derive the expression using the K map so when you populate it on the K map this is the expression i get this expression group it and apply your boolean laws and reduce expression you get this A x or B x or B I and this is the borrow expression that we have so once you get the expression the next and final step is implementing it using your gates so this is a circuit that I have using my gates so this is how you follow the design procedure or design methodology for implementing any combinational circuit remember you can implement any combinational circuit using this methodology K okay so before we start with this multiplexer let's take a break"}
