designed your basic gates which were basically implemented using transistors because we're working with logic zero and logic one levels only so those two levels were enough to depict the performance of all your digital circuits that is why they introduced a new format of your number system which is called as binary number system so in today's session we'll move forward and discuss about how to design a combinational logic circuit using all these basic gates that we have studied so learning objective so by the end of the session you should be able to describe the procedure used to design any combinational logic circuit and design a combinational logic circuit with a given specification describe the functionality of a multiplexer and implement any logic function using a multiplexer circuit so let's start with the combinational logic circuits
