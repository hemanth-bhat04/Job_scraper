{"content":"for designing this full adder circuit let's follow the same procedure for designing combinatorial logic circuits that is step one to step six first thing is understand the problem statement that we've already done we know we have to implement a full adder circuit which adds three input bits A B and one more C in which is your carry from your previous addition after that we have determined the number of inputs and outputs that is also done we have given appropriate labels or names to each of your input and output variables that is also done what is the next step we have step four populating your truth table for the combination of your inputs and outputs so that we will do now so this is my truth table for a full adder circuit so this is your sum expression this is your carry expression so we'll just look into this A B C and how do we do this the additions so A B C these are the inputs so initially first is zero plus"}
