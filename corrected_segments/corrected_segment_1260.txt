{"content":"the functions whether you go for SOP or POS in both cases the number of logic gates will be equal so in that case yeah it is up to the decision of the design engineer otherwise in practice they go with both whichever expression gives you the reduced count so that particular expression gets implemented clear yeah yes okay so others hope you have understood it the importance of SOP and POS you might wonder we have two different methods which one to go with it so this was a good question so that decision depends on the type of implementation that you have you cannot generalize it in fact but usually when we go for explanation wise usually we go with SOP because SOP is easier to implement PO or POS it is little bit difficult but you cannot generalize it to be implemented using SOP"}
