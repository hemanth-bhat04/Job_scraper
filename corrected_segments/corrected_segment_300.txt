so these are the characteristics of your combinational logic circuit so what does that mean output value can be determined if present input values are known that means this f this f value of this f purely depends on the instantaneous value of this a and b so if there is any changes in this a and b then only f changes otherwise f doesn't change that is the meaning of this output value can be determined if present inputs are known so at any instant of time your output function f depends on the present values of a and b this statement is very important for a combinational logic circuit at any instant of time the output function depends on the present values of your input variables.
