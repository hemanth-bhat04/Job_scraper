{"content":"So when it goes onto the chip, it's a transistor-level circuit that gets implemented. Not the gate-level circuit, this we call it as the gate-level circuit. So hope this design procedure is clear for you. So we have followed the same design step-step-one-to-step-seven. This design procedure or methodology is very important from the perspective of interviews. Even in interviews, they ask these procedures or methods or terminologies so this is how you design a full adder circuit. So next let's look into a multi-bit carrier ripple adder circuit. So what is this? We have seen here full adder circuit. A 'b' and 'c' all these inputs can take one bit of data at a time, that is a can be either zero or one. B can be zero or one. C"}
