{"content":"rate can't be c one c two c three what's the circuit for it over here so c one is this expression g one plus p one g nought that i've given over here right as inputs now in order to calculate this p nought g nought p one g nought g one i need the gates which are these gates that is and gate and then xor gate i don't directly don't get it here i've written it directly so when you give it to the circuit c nought c one c two c three gets generated so once this gets generated you can calculate the sum as well so this particular carry look ahead adder will be having less propagation delay as compared to this multi bit ripple carry adder but only drawback is the complexity of the circuit is more you need more gates more gates means more area but compared to the propagation delay of your carry look ahead adder for your multi ripple carry adder"}
