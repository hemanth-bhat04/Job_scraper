{"content":"so, your sum and carryout are generated, so now once your truth table is populated, the next procedure that you have to follow is you have to derive the expression for the sum and carryout, how do you derive the expression? You can use two methods: either method or using your boolean laws. So, usually for any digital circuits from the truth table, when you try to derive a boolean expression, the first thing they follow is they plot it through the K map; they realize it; or they reduce the boolean function or the expression using the K map itself."}
