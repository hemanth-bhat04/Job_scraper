{"content":"and determine how many inputs and outputs you need in order to implement the problem statement now since this is half added circuit we know directly how many inputs and outputs we need we directly label give a label to the inputs and the output variables a and b are the inputs two one bit inputs a is one input one bit input b is again another one bit input sum is the output of a half adder carryout is again an output of a half adder circuit so this half adder circuit has two outputs over here we are done with the first two steps understanding the problem statement data mining number of inputs and outputs required and also step three we are given a label a b summand c out so we are done with the step three now let's look into step four five six that is write a truth table describing the relationship between the input and the output so how can you do this so next"}
