{"content":"input bits that are a and b what if there is a carry in from your previous edition can this half adder circuit be used you cannot use this half adder circuit why because it takes only two input bits that is a and b so it cannot add a third bit that is a carry bit which comes as an output from your previous edition so we have to design another circuit which considers this carry in also that led to the design of a full adder circuit which is discussed next so in this full adder circuit it is similar to your half adder which adds two inputs a b generates a sum adder carryout but one extra thing is this carry in that means this full adder circuit consists of addition of three input bits not two bits a and b so this carry in which might be generated from your previous edition will also be taken care by this full added circuit now"}
