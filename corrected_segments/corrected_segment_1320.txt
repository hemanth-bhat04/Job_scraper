{"content":"that depends on the specification and the type of application for which you're designing with, so here when you group it when you plot it in, you cannot do any grouping of this once because sum is one for two combination so independently i have to group them so for this one what is the expression i get a bar b because it is zero so in sop if you get zero you should take a bar of it in pos if you get zero you should take a of it if you get one you should take a bar of it so this is a bar b this term and this one is a b bar that is this term, so we cannot simplify this you have to implement it as it is now if you see the c out count c out is one for only one combination and that gives me a dot b so to implement c out i need an or do i need an or gate or an and gate to implement"}
