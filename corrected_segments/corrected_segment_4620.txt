{"content":"using two is to one max so lets see how to design your basic gates using two is to one max so first lets write the two is to one max so lets see how this two is to one max works and we have already seen it so this is your y output this is my select line so this is my a and b so how does a select multiplexer work when select line is zero a goes to y when select line is one b goes to y so now lets start with designing the first circuit that is my not gate so what is the functionality of your not"}
