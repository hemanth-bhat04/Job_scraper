{"content":"to be generated it has to wait for the first full adder to generate the carry out right agreed similarly for this third full adder this third full adder for the carry in to be generated it has to wait for the second full adder to generate this carry out and similarly the fourth full adder it has to wait for the third full adder to generate this carry out clear with this yes ma'am so if you see here the delays of these gates are getting increased right if you consider this as one whole circuit if you consider this as one whole circuit sorry if you consider this as one whole circuit here this is one whole circuit if you consider so in"}
