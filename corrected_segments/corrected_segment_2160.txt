{"content":"just one bit of data but real time data will not be definitely one bit it will be multibit so if you have a multibit input a b c how do you go with the implementation of your rider circuit so they went they came up with the ripple carry adder implementation where this is an example wherein we are taking four two input data so the input data a and b each of these input data are four bit data so a is a four bit data where the example is zero one zero one b is another four bit data with an example one zero one one so this full adder circuit over here that is a ripple carry adder is using four full adder circuits so one full adder circuit was implemented using two x or gate and three and gate and one or gate so totally"}
