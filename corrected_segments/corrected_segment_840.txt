{"content":"Final logic gates a circuit consisting of logic gates but before you draw the circuit please try to reduce your boolean expression as much as possible by either using method or using your boolean laws so by k map method when you follow your appropriate grouping you will get a reduced boolean expression which can be implemented using less number of logic gate count so these are the six steps of designing any given combinational logic circuit again I'm telling you don't go to heart days it is not worth it you can just analyze it understand it these steps you can easily remember it once you understand the concept clear now let's go for designing some of your combinational logic circuit so in the next few slides we will look into how to design half adder full adder"}
