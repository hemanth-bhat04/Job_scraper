{"content":"and S is one output is B this way, so they have written this function table and written the truth table from this. Then you you have to do the K map and get the expression okay, so using the K map this is what they've got they've written A B S this way because in my truth table I've written A B S this way, so A B S is written this way, so now when you write the truth table for out. This is the expression I get A S bar plus B S plus A B, simplified it and then derived this expression A S bar plus B into S, over here for A B what I've done is S plus S bar this term I've added because S plus S bar gives me one itself and then when you do the simplification you get this A S bar plus B S, now if you see this expression I need A S bar, I need a not."}
