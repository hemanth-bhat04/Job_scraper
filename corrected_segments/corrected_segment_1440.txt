{"content":"This gate is already built into you can directly use this a here b here a x r b a x r b got it so either go with it or go with the basic gates anything is fine so let's look for the implementation so here we have implemented it using your xor gates considering that this xor gate is already available to us and this is one xor gate for your sum expression and this is one AND gate for your C out expression so if you see a half adder circuit inside you have an xor gate and one AND gate so are you done with the procedure of designing your combinational circuits in step three we had discussed what was step four writing the truth table once your truth table is written out you reduce your boolean expression that is the step"}
