{"content":"simplifying it using your k map you have done with step five so once you get the boolean expression we implemented the circuit of it that is over here we got the circuit so inside your half either if you see you have an xor and an and gate and what is inside this xor xor and an and gate what is inside this xor and an and gate transistors it is basically made up of transistors because the circuit level implementation of these individual logic gates we have discussed in the previous session this basically made up of your cmos logic a bunch of pmoss and a bunch of nmos logics so basically what goes into the layout is your transistor level circuit so hope this half added implementation is clear for you so please follow the methodology of implementing your combinational circuit that methodology is important so this is about the half added circuit wherein it adds only two transistors"}
