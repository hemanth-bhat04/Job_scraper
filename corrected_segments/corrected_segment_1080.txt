{"content":"over here we are doing the addition of it, we are not doing an operation over here we are trying to do the addition of it. first one first is this zero plus zero zero plus zero sum is zero carry is also zero next zero plus one zero plus one sum is one carry that is generated out is still zero you're done with it one plus zero one plus zero sum is one carry that is generated out is still zero this here the last one one plus one so one plus one it is, it's not an operation if it was an operation one plus one will give you a one itself since this is binary addition one plus one the sum is zero carry is one."}
