{"content":"a dot s b dot s i need two and gates and one or operator and that means one or gate so now if you see the circuit level one or gate two and gates one or gate so this is inside the multiplexer circuit so this is my multiplexer circuit inside my multiplexer circuit this is what i have this is my output these are the inputs a b are the inputs so this is a two is to one multiplex circuit i follow the same design procedure what i have used for the combinational logic circuit clear uh-huh okay so this is one of the applications of a multiplexer circuit so as i told you multiplexer circuit it is selecting one of your two inputs here any one of the inputs not two inputs in this case it is a two input"}
