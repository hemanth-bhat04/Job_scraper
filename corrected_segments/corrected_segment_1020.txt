{"content":"you have to derive the two tables for your half adder circuit, so this is my two tables for my half adder. I know A and B are the inputs, so since A and B are the inputs, right, the combinations for A and B are the inputs. Totally, how many combinations I'll get? Two to the power of 2 because all these digital circuits follow your binary number system in binary number system. I have only two logic levels, zero and one, since there are two inputs; it should be two to the power of 2, so in general, it should be two to the power of n where n depends on the number of inputs. So, since in my case for half added I have two inputs A and B, two to the power of 2 generates four different combinations: zero zero zero one one zero one one. This is your sum and the carryout; so hope you know that to table of this half adder circuit."}
