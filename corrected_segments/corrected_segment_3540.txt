{"content":"okay, so we were discussing about the full adder half adder full subtractor half subtractor circuits those are also combinational circuits now we will move on with the another set of combinational circuit which is a multiplexer circuit so this is also a combinational logic circuit which is used frequently especially inside an integrated circuit that is inside a chip, we are using these circuits more frequently over here, so we'll look into the functionality of this multiplexer, so this multiplexer circuit is a circuit that selects one among the several inputs and connects it to the output, since it selects one of the inputs and connects to the output, it is also called as a data selector circuit, so this is just an symbolic representation of a multiplexer circuit. I have represented a two as to one multiplexer, so for a multiplexer circuit, the output line will be always one itself."}
