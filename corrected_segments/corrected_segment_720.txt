{"content":"names to your input and output variables the next step that you will be following is writing a truth table which describes the relationship between the input and the output variables when you want your output variables to go high when you want your output variables to go low so that purely depends on the input variables so the relationship which the parameter which gives you the relationship between your input and output variable is my truth table so you need to populate the truth table once you finish labeling your input and output variables because you know the problem statement you know what functionality based on the functionality you decide a number of inputs outputs now write a truth table for those inputs and outputs to depict the functionality of the problem statement so once you have a truth table after that you have to convert that truth table into a digital"}
