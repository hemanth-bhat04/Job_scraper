{"content":"and clock two click two so this clock one and clock two has to be sent to all the blocks to select that you have a multiplexer circuit so when the select pin the select pin might be a test pin here it selects the mode sorry so this is a mode pin so when it is in zero mode clock one gets transmitted when it is in mode one your clock two gets transmitted and so on so this is how your multiplexer gets used inside your integrated circuit so this is one of your applications of your integrated circuit clear with it okay so next let's look into your demultiplexer circuit so demultiplex"}
