{"content":"in can be zero or one, what if you have more than one input bits. definitely input bits will be more than one bit just a second, so we were implementing this full adder circuit using the same methodology as we have designed the combinational circuits so hope this is clear for you implementation part of your full adder circuits, so next we were discussing about the multi-bit carrier ripple adder so this full adder circuits was implemented for one bit of data a b c was adding"}
