We derived an expression from the expression we derived the logic circuit so that was the basic procedure that we followed in designing your any given specification so to implement that specification we use all your logic gates so all logic gates interconnected to represent a boolean function is nothing but a combinational logic circuit so if you look into this combinational logic circuit it will have a set of inputs and a single output or more than one output that depends on the specification but at any instant of time if you consider any combinational logic circuit the output function f at any instant of time purely depends on the input variables a and b in this case that is f is a function of the input variables a and b if a and b changes then f changes
