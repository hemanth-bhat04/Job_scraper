{"content":"okay, so this is one of the application of a demultiplexer circuit over there. Here what I'm doing is, I'm going to merge few signals over there. This is my input signal that I'm getting. So, this input signal will be merged with it. It can be passed through many of your switches in order for to generate a different waveform of your signal. That's an amplifier circuit with a different gain. So, this is just an amplifier circuit if you want to vary the gain of this amplifier circuit. I have used a demultiplexer which is acting like a switch for me. When the signal is passed through a different variation of your resistor, the input voltage over there varies and with that variation, I get a different gain of your output voltage. So, here the demultiplex circuit is basically working like a switch selector. The controlling of the switch is done."}
