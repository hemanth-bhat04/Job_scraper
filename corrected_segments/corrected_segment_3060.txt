{"content":"c out to be generated the present c out will be directly calculated using the present input a and b and the previous inputs a naught b naught and the previous in the first c in it need not wait for this intermediate c naught to be generated but of course the complexity of the circuit will be more the area consumed is more but propagation delay is minimized so now if you go for implementing this circuit in this way then this is how your circuit looks this is a carry look ahead adder we call it as carry look ahead adder why because a carry is generated previously so p naught g naught are supplied to it what is this p naught g naught it depends on this equation p naught and g naught are a xor b and a dot b you have to use a xor gate for getting these terms"}
