{"content":"circuit but to implement your full adders sorry ripple carry adder circuit we will be using full adder circuits over here so here i've taken an example of a four bit data so i need four full adder circuits individually full adders are adding one bit of data a naught b naught so here my data is over here are this is a naught a one a two a three and similarly for this b i have b naught b one b two b three so a naught and b naught are given for that is these two inputs are given for the first adder next these two inputs are given for the second adder next these two inputs are given for the third adder and the last one is given for the fourth full adder circuit so now individual adders will be adding all these"}
