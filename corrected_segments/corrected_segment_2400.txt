{"content":"one and zero one plus zero sum is one carry is zero one plus one sum is zero carry is one again this one comes here what is the input to the final full adder zero and one zero and one zero plus one sum is one carry is zero again one plus one sum is zero carry out is one clear so if you see here if you see this for the second full adder if you see the second full adder so the second full adder even though the inputs are given to all the full adders at the same instance because a and b are generated at that same instance so all the full adders will be getting these a three b three b two a two b one a one at the same instance but if you see the carry in for all the full adder starting from the second full adder for this carry in to be generated for this carry"}
