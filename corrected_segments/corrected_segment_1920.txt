{"content":"mistake i don't have roots okay so here when you do the club grouping this is the expression you get for c out b c a b and a c so now once you got the expression the next step is the final step is so over here from the k map once you get the expression again you can club them and minimize them using your boolean loss this is the expression we got a xor b xor c we have an xor gate so directly we can implement this expression using your xor gate instead of using this expression over here instead of using this expression so this might result in more number of transistor count or more number of gate count means more transistors but whereas if you see this three input xor gate the transistor count implementation might be quite less as compared to this expression that is why we have grouped them and converted into this a xor b xor c"}
