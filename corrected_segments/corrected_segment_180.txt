circuit a combinational logic circuit is composed of groups of logic gates such as i told you so these combinational logic circuits are basically designed using the basic logic gates we have discussed so when you have a group of logic gate that circuit is called as a combinational logic circuit if you have a single gate then that becomes a functionality of your particular logic gate when you club a group of logic gates that circuit is called as a combinational logic circuit so it is an interconnection of logic gates to represent any boolean function so boolean function is used to represent the specification in the previous class we have taken an example of a problem statement an english statement which was translated into a formal logic or a boolean function or a boolean expression and we evaluated that boolean expression and got the two truth tables out of it so from the truth table
