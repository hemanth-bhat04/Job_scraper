{"content":"circuit just a minute, I'll clear this so this is a demultiplexer circuit. So inside a demultiplexer circuit, if you see the functionality for demultiplexer circuit is opposite to that of your multiplexer circuit, so here I've taken my demultiplexer circuit for one input pin, and four output pins again - the same thing select pins depend on the number of outputs, I have, so two select pins decide which of your output gets activated. So it's this way, I'm so, how does the D Max works? This is translated either to Y3 or Y2 or Y1 or Y0 depending on the select pin."}
