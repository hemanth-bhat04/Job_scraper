{"content":"with the finalizing the problem statement deciding how many inputs and outputs and assigning a label to the inputs the next step that we have in the design procedure is populating the outputs that is populating the truth table so once this is done derive the expression using k map now let's look into this particular truth table zero minus zero is zero so again zero minus these are the inputs still here zero minus zero is difference is zero borrow is zero next zero minus zero is equal to zero that minus one zero minus one so now i need a borrow so i need to get a borrow here so getting a borrow means it is equal into two two minus one difference is one since i got a borrow borrow term becomes one now zero minus one so here itself i need to get a borrow"}
