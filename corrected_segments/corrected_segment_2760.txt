{"content":"over here, so it basically depends on A and B here see here, in this case, A and B are both one. It's both one, your C out is one, so A dot B, so whenever A and B are one, C out is one either it depends on this or these two conditions: if you see that is this one and this one, it's zero one and one zero, so any one of this A or B or A x or B, so you can have an XOR gate over here or just an OR gate also both will do, and then it basically depends on C in, if these two operations don't give you a one, it depends on the C in, if C in is one, if C in is one, your output is one over here, so basically we have derived the C out expression using this A B."}
