{"content":"so my borrowed term is one two minus one is one one minus zero is one zero minus one again i need a borrowed here so the borrowed term becomes one now the borrow is two two minus one is one one minus one is zero next one minus zero is one one minus one is difference is one borrow is zero next one minus zero is one one minus one difference is zero borrow is zero one minus one is zero zero minus zero is difference is zero borrow is zero one minus one is zero zero minus one i need a borrow here so it is as good as getting a two term borrow is one i got a borrow two minus one is one clear with this so now you populated the truth table"}
