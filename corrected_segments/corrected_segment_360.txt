value in case of a combinational logic circuit if you have to store an output value then you have to go for a sequential circuit you need a memory so that is a basic difference between combinational logic circuit and sequential logic circuit in combinational logic circuit output at any instant of time depends purely on the present input there is no storage of your previous value or there is no retention of your previous value possible in a combinational logic circuit so in the interviews they will ask this question the main difference between sequential and logic combinational logic circuit so here is an example now what will this combinational logic circuit consist of it will be made up of basic gates an and gate an or gate a not gate one more gate
