not gate and using these gates we have also designed the derived gates that is your nand gate nor gate xor gate and xnor gate now using all these logics we'll see how we can design a combinational logic circuits so basically all these combinational logic circuits are designed using the logic gates which we have studied in the previous session logic gates were designed in order to implement your boolean operators which is basically an operator or not nand not and so on all these operators were having functionality on your digital number binary number system so all your processing that is taking place inside a digital circuit was with respect to logic zero and logic one and for all these and for these number systems the basic operators that we defined we called as boolean operators which are all the or operators and and not
