yes ma'am okay okay so in the previous session we have seen the importance of boolean algebra and how boolean algebra is being used to design any digital circuits so we'll continue with that so in today's session we will be discussing about the combinational logic circuits so to design this combinational logic circuits we will be using the logic gates which we have discussed in the previous session that is on boolean algebra topic so in boolean algebra we have discussed about the boolean operators and for each of the boolean operators we had designed the basic gates the gates are or
