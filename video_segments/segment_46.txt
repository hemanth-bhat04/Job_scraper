The layout of a flat full chip shows that there is no hierarchy here. These are all the I/Os, which perform the function of transferring data in and out of the chip. What you see here are all the hard macros—maybe this is a PLL—and all the memories. In the middle, you see the logic gates: AND gates, NAND gates, flip-flops, and other components. They are placed within the blue region. The horizontal and vertical lines in green (vertical) and red (horizontal) represent the power nets, which distribute power throughout the chip. Power enters from outside, as indicated by the red lines.
