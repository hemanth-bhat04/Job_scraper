So, the top-level engineer's job is simplified now. Once all the timing issues at the top level and any DRC/LVS issues are resolved, you can export the entire design down to the transistor-level layout. You can then write out a flat GDSII file, which contains the layout information in terms of layers, wells, diffusions, and so on. This file is sent to the foundry for manufacturing. That's about the hierarchical implementation flow. In the hierarchical implementation flow, things happen in parallel. So, we discussed two flows: flat and hierarchical. The setup for these flows involves...
