Hello everyone, this course will primarily focus on physical design flow, and this particular section will talk about the physical design flow overview. So, for example, there are multiple steps in a flow. It starts with the first step, which is basically floor planning, and inside floor planning, there are two or three steps. Then, there is something called placement and routing, and inside placement and routing, we basically call it PNR. There are again multiple steps, like clock synthesis, cross-talk DRC check, and so on. So, this particular section will talk about the overview of the physical design flow, and the following sections will take each step into detail and try to explain it, with the help of some lectures.
