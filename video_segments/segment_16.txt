Spacing is not a constant number because the distance between two Metal 1 features varies depending on the width of the Metal 1 itself. The value shown here represents the minimum spacing required. However, the actual spacing increases as the width of the Metal 1 wire becomes larger. Additionally, for longer distances where two Metal 1 features are running parallel, the spacing between them also increases.
