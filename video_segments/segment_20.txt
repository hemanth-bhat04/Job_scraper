Or, two or three cycles later, it will increase the jitter. This will make your timing closure more complicated because the jitter reduces the amount of time available in the clock period. They might have guidelines on how you should connect the power to the PLL, and all of that is included in your macro usage guidelines. So, you should read these guidelines before jumping into the floorplan and trying to implement anything.  

Pin connection guidelines are also important. Sometimes, these macros will come with more than one VDD or VSS. For example, they might have ten VDD pins and ten VSS pins, but the guidelines might specify that you should connect at least five of them. These extra pins are created to make your design easier, but it may not always be possible to connect all ten due to layout constraints. However, connecting at least five of them is usually sufficient.
