Pins just like that—you can’t have a dedicated pin for DFT (Design for Test) because having a pin on the package comes at a cost. Allocating a pin solely for testing purposes isn’t financially viable, as no one is willing to spend extra money to make the package more complex. If you have more pins, it means the package needs to accommodate more pins, and each pin adds to the overall cost. To reduce costs, DFT pins are typically shared. When you’re in DFT mode, your functional pins act as DFT pins. Therefore, you’ll need to know which pins are shared between DFT and functional components because those pins will have multiple timing characteristics. DFT has one set of timing requirements, while the functional part has a completely different set. Understanding this is important.

Next, let’s discuss macro usage guidelines. Macros are components like memories or PLLs (Phase-Locked Loops), and they
