They probably already have that information, and sometimes when you receive the first netlist, you might find that the given area isn’t sufficient to fit the netlist—it’s quite possible. In such cases, something might be wrong, so knowing the target die size is important. Gate count is a related term, as it is directly related to the die size. Then, there’s the worst-case voltage drop in the power network, which is related to the power distribution. The power network has resistance, as we saw with core straps, core rings, and other structures when looking at a full-chip layout. These are the wires on the layout that supply current to every transistor. When current passes through these wires, there is a voltage drop due to the resistance (I × R). Whatever voltage drop occurs in the wire...
