So, that was the requirement. We can see that this cannot be captured in Liberty because Liberty has no constructs to explain it. Since this cannot be captured in Liberty, it becomes a timing guideline, which is documented in the usage document supplied with the IP you purchased. All such timing requirements are typically handled by the layout engineers. You may end up having to write a script to compute the delay, extract the delay from your layout, and then manually check it against the guidelines. That was an example of STA (Static Timing Analysis) guidelines for digital hard macros. Now, let’s discuss testing connections. We’ve already talked about this earlier.
