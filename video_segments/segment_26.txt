Which we used to work on had a strange requirement. Say that was our service, and inside this service, it used to send a clock out. That clock would then be captured by a flip-flop in another block, and from there, the clock was returned. Internally, that clock came back inside to the service. When this happened, the entire round-trip delay—the clock going out and coming back—shouldn’t exceed, say, five hundred microseconds.
