It involves partitioning the design at the layout level. The process starts with a full netlist, which is then broken down into smaller chunks for the layout. This partitioning may or may not align with the partitioning done during synthesis. Looking at the picture will make this clearer. Here, you see the layout where all the I/Os are placed around the periphery, and inside the layout, specific areas have been allocated to different parts of the netlist. These areas are labeled as Block 1, Block 2, Block 3, Block 4, Block 5, and Block 6.
