So, we've worked on logic synthesis and DFT. We also learned about LEC, and now we're at the stage of APR. This is the topic of the next part of the project. The entire project will be completely based on APR. Before we started this project, someone must have already completed the RTL design. They should have performed RTL verification, completed logic synthesis, and inserted DFT. They should have also run LEC and pre-layout STA. At that point, they would have handed off the netlist to us, and that is the state we are in now. We have a netlist to start with.
