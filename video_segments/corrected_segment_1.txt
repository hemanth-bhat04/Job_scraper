Considering a netlist where the design has around sixty million gates, you might pick, for example, ten million gates and place them into Block One. All the gates related to that million gates are placed here, another million gates here, and so on. The specific numbers, such as one million or ten million, are just examples; it doesn't have to be exactly ten million, as some blocks might contain five, others ten, and so forth. When assigning a chunk of the netlist to a specific area, you must ensure the related logic is placed there. You cannot assign random logic to Block Oneâ€”it must be related logic. Grouping this logic together should avoid breaking timing-critical logic across blocks, which is essential for maintaining coherence.
