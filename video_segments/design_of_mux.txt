yes ma'am okay okay so in the previous session we have seen the importance of boolean algebra and how boolean algebra is being used to design any digital circuits so we'll continue with that so in today's session we will be discussing about the combinational logic circuits so to design this combinational logic circuits we will be using the logic gates which we have discussed in the previous session that is in boolean algebra topic so in boolean algebra we have discussed about the boolean operators and for each of the boolean operators we had designed the basic gates the basic gates are and or
not gate and using these gates we have also designed the derived gates that is your nand gate nor gate xor gate and xnor gate now using all these logics we'll see how we can design a combinational logic circuits so basically all these combinational logic circuits are designed using the logic gates which we have studied in the previous session logic gates were designed in order to implement your boolean operators which is basically and operator or not nand not and so on all these operators were having functionality on your digital number binary number system so all your processing that is taking place inside a digital circuit was with respect to logic zero and logic one and for all these and for these number systems the basic operators that we defined we called as boolean operators which are all the or operators and and not and to implement these operators we
designed your basic gates which were basically implemented using transistor because transistors we're working with logic zero and logic one levels only so those two levels were enough to depict the performance of all your digital circuits that is why they introduced a new format of your number system which is called as binary number system so in today's session we'll move forward and discuss about how to design a combinational logic circuit using all these basic gates that we have studied so learning learning objective so by the end of the session you should be able to describe the procedure used to design any combinational logic circuit and design a combinational logic circuit with a given specification describe the functionality of a multiplexer and implement any logic function using a multiplexer circuit so let's start with the combinational logics
