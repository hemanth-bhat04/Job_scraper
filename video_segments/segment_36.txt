You can obtain some design information from the architecture design engineers. Additionally, the RTL designers can provide you with pin naming conventions. Generally, RTL engineers follow specific pin naming conventions. For example, a signal that exits Block 1 and connects to Block 2 might be named as "Block1\_Block2\_something." This naming convention helps identify that the signal is intended for Block 2. Such information can sometimes be useful for your floorplanning efforts. Regarding the netlist and gate count, this information is typically available from the RTL designers. Then, there are clock domains: you need to know how many clocks are in your design, which ones are synchronous, and which ones are asynchronous.
