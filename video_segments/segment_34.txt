Since we say it’s all automatic, if a tool has to route something without any DRC violations, you should know the DRC rules. That’s why the DRC rules are included in the tech file. Okay, so then there are parasitic models. PEC stands for Parasitic Extraction. The tool needs access to the parasitic extraction models because otherwise, it cannot determine what amount of resistance (R) and capacitance (C) a wire drawn on the layout represents. All of these are also technology-related. There are two more technology-related files called ITF (Interconnect Technology Format) and TLUPlus. ITF stands for Interconnect Technology Format, and this is the only file that comes to you from the foundry when you are working on the...
