Oh, like maybe a SerDes (Serializer/Deserializer). SerDes stands for Serializer-Deserializer, and these cells are designed to handle only data without a clock input. Transmitting the clock is very difficult, especially in chip-to-chip communication. The biggest challenge is that you have to transmit both data and the clock, but the clock frequency is at least twice the data frequency. For example, if you transmit a 1 GHz clock, the maximum data frequency is limited to half of that, which is 500 MHz, because you can change the data only at the rising edge of the clock. So, what if we avoid transmitting the clock? If we donâ€™t transmit the clock, we can potentially transmit the data at double the speed.
