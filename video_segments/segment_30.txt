Transmit only the data. Now, my data can toggle at 1 GHz. However, the problem with this approach is that without a clock, synchronous circuits won’t work because they rely on the clock as a reference. That’s where SerDes comes in. Internally, the SerDes guesses where the clock is because it knows that whenever a data transition occurs, that’s where the clock transition should have happened. Let’s see if I can illustrate that. Suppose the data makes a transition here. If the data transition happens like this, it means the clock must have made a transition at the same point.
