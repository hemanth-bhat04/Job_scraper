That comes from the library vendor, and as a layout engineer, I won’t change it. I’ll simply refer to it. That’s why it is placed in the reference library. The reference library contains, in a Milky Way database, a Unix directory. Under that directory, you navigate into the reference library. Within that directory, you’ll see three subdirectories: `cell`, `frame`, and `lm`. If you go into the `cell` directory and list its contents, you’ll see the names of all the cells. The files under the `cell` directory contain the complete layouts of all the standard cells. These files include all the necessary information, such as details about the cells’ structures and specifications.
