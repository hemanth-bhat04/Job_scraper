A data flow diagram doesnâ€™t explain the functionality; it only shows how the data flows within your chip. For example, it might indicate that data enters through these two pins, then goes to Block 1. From Block 1, it moves to Block 6, and from Block 6, it goes to Block 2. The interface between Block 1 and Block 3 is critical, so that kind of information is present in the data flow diagram. While this is a simplified representation, it provides enough detail for layout engineers to use and develop the layout. This is the most important information you can get from the architecture design engineers. They can also highlight logic clusters that are critical or high-speed, such as by saying that the interface between these two blocks is very critical.
