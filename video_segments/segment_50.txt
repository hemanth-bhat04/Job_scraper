So, the NDM (Netlist Description Model) stores data in mainly two different formats. One format is a single file, where the reference library is stored as a single file. If you look further inside, each cell (e.g., cell one, cell two, cell three, etc.) will have views such as timing, frame, and layout. All of these views for each cell are combined and packaged into one NDM file. On Unix systems, for instance, you'll see just one file that contains information about all the cells. This is how the NDM format is used for the reference library. Additionally, NDM also supports a distributed file system, which is typically used for the design library. In this case, the design library is the top-level directory.
