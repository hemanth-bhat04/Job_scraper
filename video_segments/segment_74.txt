The design library is where you store your layout information. For example, if you're working on a chip and have created a floorplan for it, the floorplan data is stored within the design library. The design library itself is in a specific format called Milky Way. Additionally, the design library has a link to the reference library, which is kept separate because the tool must know the contents of the reference library, and those contents cannot be changed. The only changes allowed are to the contents of the design library. If you look inside the design library, you'll find that it is a unique directory containing two items: one file and one directory. The file, named `lib`, serves as a table of contents, keeping track of all the cells present in the database.
