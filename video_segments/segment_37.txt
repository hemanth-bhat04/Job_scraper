As we discussed earlier, none of these happen in a modular flow like this or a sequential flow like this. In reality, once the RTL design is completed, only then does RTL verification begin, followed by synthesis, LEC, STA, and APR. However, real designs don't follow this linear approach. Instead, someone might be working on the RTL design while another person starts working on RTL verification. They likely create test plans and use parts of the incomplete RTL code to run RTL verification. As soon as some RTL design is available, synthesis may already be underway, with different team members working on it. Meanwhile, the DFT engineer is already involved in planning what kind of DFT needs to be implemented. When the first netlist becomes available, API work can begin.
