The small rectangles here, right? These are the ones that make a connection from the I/O to the power network. This is where the power connection happens. Power also comes from the outside world, so it enters through this I/O and then gets connected to the power network. Within this power network, you can see something surrounding the area; this is called the **core ring**. The horizontal and vertical lines you see here are called the **core straps**. We'll talk about this again. You can see that, for example, this is the memory, and the horizontal and vertical lines here represent all the connections made to this macro. The VDD and VSS of this macro are connected to the power network in this way.
