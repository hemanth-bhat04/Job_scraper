I referred to it as a "floor plan," and you'll see an entry for it here. After placement, I created another one, which is also present here. I can create multiple floor plans—floor plan 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or any number of floor plans—and all of them get saved here. These are all binary files, so there is nothing you can do with them using Unix commands apart from listing them. Okay, so that's about the Milky Way. But in the latest tool called ICC2, a different model is used. This model is called NDM (New Data Model). The purpose of the NDM is the same as the Milky Way, but it is designed to be much faster, likely due to advancements in technology. So, ICC2 uses the NDM.
