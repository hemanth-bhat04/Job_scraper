So, here, the same concepts apply: there will be a reference library and a design library. The design library contains multiple blocks, and a block is very similar to a cell in Milky Way. In Milky Way, a cell is equivalent to a block in NDM. For example, Block A might represent a floor plan, Block B might represent placement, and Block C might represent another version of the floor plan. The design library also includes links to the reference library. Reference libraries like `reflib1`, `reflib2`, and `reflib3` (all in NDM format) can be linked into the design library. The design library also contains:
