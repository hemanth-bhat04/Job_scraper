So that gives you flexibility, which is why they will provide more than ten pins—more than the required number of pins—but they expect you to make at least a certain number of connections. All of these details are present in the guidelines. OTC stands for "Over-the-Cell" routing restrictions. It specifies what restrictions apply to routing over the cell. For example, we saw that the PLL internally uses Metal 1 to Metal 5, so those five metals are obviously unavailable for use at the top level. However, you can use Metal 6 and above. The guidelines might demand, for instance, "Don’t route Metal 6 over it," or "Route Metal 7 to avoid crosstalk." Additionally, there are SKA (Standard Key Attributes) guidelines for digital hard macros. These hard macros are more complex cells.
