Where the layout engineers learn about the design, figure out the right strategies to close it, identify what issues exist, and determine how to modify the existing flow to address those issuesâ€”all of these questions get answered in the initial phases. By the time you reach the final stage, there should be little left to do; it becomes more of a "push-button" flow, where you simply press a button, and the layout should be ready. That is the goal they aim for. By that stage, all the necessary learning should have already taken place.  

This is why we are at a point where the current netlist contains most of the intended features, but there are still bugs. For example, some timing constraints might not be met, the SDC (Static Design Constraints) file could be incomplete, the flow itself might not be fully developed, there could be bugs in the flow, or certain settings might be missing.
