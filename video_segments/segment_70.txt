Again, this is for the tools to handle. There's nothing for you to do. You should never go to the design library using Unix commands and try to change anything there. If you do that, your database will get corrupted, and you will lose your data. All the contents of the design library should be handled through the tool commands. To create the design library, there is a command called `create_mw_lib`. In ICC, for example, you can use that command to create the design library. Below that, there is another directory called "cell," where all your saved cells are stored. So, for instance, if I had created a floorplan, I would have saved my design after completing the floorplan.
