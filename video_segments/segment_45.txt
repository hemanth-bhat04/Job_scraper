Okay, so this is the ITF (Interconnect Technology File). As you can see, the dielectric constants are defined here. For example, Metal 7 has a specified thickness, and its sheet resistance is also listed. The dielectric between Metal 7 and Metal 6 has a dielectric constant of a certain value, with a specific thickness. These values define the wire resistances. You can see that everything we discussed is captured in this file. However, again, there is no...
