Right, so all such information is defined here. For example, color names like "green," "bound," and "brown" are referenced as "40," "3," and so on. Stipples, which are patterns of vertical or horizontal lines, are also defined here. These stipple patterns are specified in detail. This section provides information for "ME1," which corresponds to the Metal 1 layer. It includes the layer number, the mask name ("Metal 1"), and various design rules such as default width, minimum area, minimum width, maximum width, and spacing between Metal 1 features. These are all design rules, and specifically, the spacing rule mentioned here is part of the "fact table."
