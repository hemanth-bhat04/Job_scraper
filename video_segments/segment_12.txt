However, if the issue is related to the layout itself, which is something under the control of the layout engineer, there is no need to involve anyone else. The layout engineer themselves will have to make the necessary fixes and proceed. Okay, so that was about the AC design flow and where we stand now. This is a flat implementation flow, which we've looked at before. Also, in the synthesis...
