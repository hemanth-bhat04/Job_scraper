What are their frequencies, or at least the expected frequencies? Then, consider the voltage domains: How many voltage domains are there in your design? Which ones are shut down, and which ones are always on? All of this information can be obtained from here. Next, thereâ€™s DFT (Design for Test) information: What kind of DFT implementation has been done? Do we have scan chains? Are there P/Bs (Parallel/Block tests)? Is there L-BIST (Logic Built-In Self-Test)? What types of DFT have been implemented in this design?  

When you implement DFT, some additional pins are introduced. For example, scan-in, scan-out, and scan-enable pins are added due to DFT. There could be many more pins like this, each bringing in its own set of requirements. However, typically, the DFT team will not get...
