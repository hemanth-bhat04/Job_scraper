The tool does not need to know how the envelope looks. All it needs to know is the shape of, say, an AND gate, where the A pin, B pin, and Y pin are located in the layout, and whether there are any areas in the layout where routing should not occur. This is all the information required for the layout tool. The rest of the information is unnecessary dataâ€”if you load it, it will just consume more memory on your machine. To reduce that memory footprint, we use the `from` view. The `from` view is a condensed version of the layout information, and it is generated from the LEF (Layout Exchange Format) file. The LEF file is one of the files handed off by the library team. Then, there is the LM (Library Macro) file.
