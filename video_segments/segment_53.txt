The shape for it is defined, so Block 1 should look like a square-ish shape, Block 3 looks more rectangular, and there is one L-shaped block. An area has been assigned to each block, and its location on the layout is also determined. When placing the blocks, there should be a reason why Block 1 and Block 2 are sitting next to each other. Perhaps because there are timing-critical paths crossing between them, so signals from Block 1 predominantly go to Block 2. However, the communication between Block 1 and Block 6 is likely not timing-critical, or the amount of signal transfer between them is very low. Thatâ€™s why these two blocks are probably placed farther apart. So, this design partition is...
