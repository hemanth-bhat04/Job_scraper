An additional consideration during floorplanning involves the target die size and aspect ratio. Even before creating the initial netlist, you won’t know exactly how much area the design will occupy. However, the target die size is usually fixed very early in the design process because it directly relates to the cost of the chip. Before the company begins designing, they would have already calculated the production costs and estimated the potential profit based on the chip’s size. Since the production cost and profitability depend heavily on the chip’s dimensions, the target die size is established early on.
