The envelope shapes, including the diffusion shapes, contacts, metals, and every layer, are present in the layout that is placed under `cl` or `cell`. From there, youâ€™ll also see the same set of cells, but this time it represents an abstract view. An abstract view means that it is not a complete layout; it contains only a partial layout. This partial layout is required to reduce the amount of data that needs to be loaded. For example, if our layout is at the gate level (and we are not working at the transistor level), then:
