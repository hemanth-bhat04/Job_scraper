All the parts of this netlist—let’s say your design was around sixty million gates—and you pick, for example, ten million gates and place them into Block One. So, all the gates related to that one million gate will be placed here, another million gate here, and so on. I mean, one million gates or ten million gates is just an example, and it doesn’t have to be exactly ten; some blocks might contain five, others ten, and so on. But when you assign a chunk of the netlist to a specific area, you must ensure that the related logic is placed there. You can’t take random logic and assign it to Block One—it has to be related logic. When you group these logics together, they should make sense in terms of not breaking the timing-critical logic across the blocks. Right? It is very important to maintain this coherence.
