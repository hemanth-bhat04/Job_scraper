To the concept we discussed during synthesis, we tried to ensure that when we perform partitioning—whether top-down or bottom-up—the way we break up the hierarchy should be such that we avoid sharing critical-path logic between two different partitions. Sharing critical-path logic between partitions can worsen timing results. The same principle applies here. From the complete netlist, we identify logic that is fairly self-contained and group it into blocks. During synthesis, partitioning was purely logical, but here, it involves physical partitioning. This means not only assigning specific parts of the logic to certain areas but also defining their physical placement.
