A design engineer working on an APR (Advanced Physical Design) tool receives all the technology information from the library vendor. The only file that comes directly from the foundry (fab) is the ITF (Interconnect Technology File). The ITF file defines the cross-section profile of the process. In other words, when you take a chip, cut it, and look at it from the side, you'll see the profile view. That profile view is defined in the ITF file.
