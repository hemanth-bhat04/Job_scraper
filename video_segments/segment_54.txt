In such cases, models exist where companies like Cisco will not share all the intricate details of the chip with Broadcom. They will only provide what is necessary. If Broadcom needs additional information, they must explain why it is required, and Cisco will only share it if they deem it important. Given this scenario, itâ€™s not possible to know everything about the design. However, during floorplanning, certain information is essential. Floorplanning is primarily about minimizing wire lengths, so you might want to place key blocks in the floorplan in such a way that critical components are placed close to each other. That kind of information is provided to you through the data flow diagram.
