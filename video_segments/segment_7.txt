Under this directory, all your timing libraries are present. However, none of these libraries are stored in their original formats. For example, you cannot directly access or read the `.db` files under `lm`. Instead, the tool stores them in its own internal database format, so you may not be able to read them directly from here. Nevertheless, the contents of the `lm` directory come from the `.db` files, the contents under `frame` come from the `.lef` files, and the contents below `cl` come from the GDS files. All of these libraries were originally provided by the library vendor.

There is a flow that Synopsys offers, which can read all this information and generate a reference library for you. Essentially, a translation process occurs to convert the original library formats into a format usable by the tool. That's an overview of the reference library. Now, let's discuss the design library.
