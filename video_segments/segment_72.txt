Chips are so complex that trying to understand their functionality can be challenging. At the very top level, you might know something general, like whether the chip is intended for a mobile platform. However, gaining a deep understanding of its functionality is rarely possible due to the sheer complexity and the limited time available. Even if the design is from the same company—say, Samsung—you might have access to architecture engineers and RTL design engineers nearby, allowing you to ask questions and gather information. But in other situations, such as when the RTL is designed by Cisco and the layout is done by Broadcom, obtaining that level of insight becomes significantly more difficult.
