Yes, this happens when the clock tree is built. After the clock tree is constructed, we move on to the routing phase, where the wires are added. Until now, the connections between the cells in the layout are, in a sense, imaginary. While the tool has a rough idea of how to route them, the actual wires or metal pieces have not yet been added to the layout. In other words, the metal polygons have not been defined—it’s merely a conceptual or abstract representation of the layout. All those metal polygons are added during the routing phase. Typically, routing consumes a significant amount of resources; you often need larger machines, and the runtime can be quite long. Once the routing is complete, the design becomes much more complex and resource-intensive.
