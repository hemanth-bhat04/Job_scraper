So, let's start by understanding the design setup and floor plan. The objective of this module is to introduce the automatic place-and-route flow and focus on the first phase of this process, which involves design setup and floor planning. After completing this module, you will have a general idea of what makes a good floor plan and gain the knowledge to implement a floor plan at both the chip and block levels.

Our agenda includes reviewing the basic design flow, which we have already touched upon. We will discuss what design setup entails, what a floor plan is, and the differences between block-level and chip-level floor plans. Additionally, we will cover the data required for creating a floor plan.
