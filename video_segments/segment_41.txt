You won’t be able to do everything you wanted because there are constraints along with it. We’ll talk about that when we discuss the package, as the package also determines the voltage drop. If you use a flip-chip package, you’ll experience a smaller voltage drop compared to a wire-bond package. Knowing the package is important, and having access to the block diagram and pin diagram is helpful. It’s better to review these documents before jumping into floor planning, as the type of package determines how you approach the floor plan. We’ll see an example later. The way you lay out the design for a wire-bond package is different from the way you do it for a flip-chip package. That’s about the design information.
