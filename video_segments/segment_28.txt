Because, as we said, it contains the thickness of the silicon dioxide and the dielectric constant. Both of these pieces of information are required to calculate the parasitic capacitance. It also contains the sheet resistance of Metal 1 and the thickness of Metal 1, which are needed to determine the resistance of the wire. However, the tools cannot read the ITF file directly. In the case of Synopsys tools, the ITF is converted into what is called a TLU+ (Technology Library Update Plus) format. There are tools available that read the ITF file and generate the TLU+ file. The TLU+ models are a set of models that capture advanced process effects and can be used by parasitic extraction tools in Synopsys Place and Route (P&R) flows.
