Also, design rules are present in standalone physical verification decks. Before you tape out the chip, it’s not enough to meet design rules just for the metal layers—you have to meet them for every layer. Though the API tool didn’t do anything, let’s consider an example: when an inverter (say, Inverter 1x) was independently designed, the designer who created it would check the design rules for Inverter 1x and ensure everything is clean. However, what happens if Inverter 1x is placed next to a flip-flop? The interaction between them could cause a design rule violation that hasn’t been checked yet. This is difficult to verify because there are thousands of cells, and each cell can sit next to thousands of other cells in the design.
