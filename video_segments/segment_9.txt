This is part of the full chip design, which you will likely work on much later, possibly after the project is complete. This project focuses on implementing one of the blocksâ€”it could be Block 1, Block 3, or any of these blocks. The project is specifically about block implementation, so please be clear about that. Okay, so once each block has been carved out both logically and physically, and a shape has been assigned to it, the block becomes independent. At this point, you can export the shape of the block, and you can also determine where the ports for this block should be located. For example, some ports can be here because they might be communicating with Block 2, so the ports for Block 2 will be positioned there. That way, the connectivity is managed effectively.
